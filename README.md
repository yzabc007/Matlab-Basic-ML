# basic-machine-learning-algorithms
This simple project is to deepen my understading of machine learning and to record the basic machine learning algorithms I learned from CSE5523: Machine Learning taught by Prof. Mikhail Belkin as well as algorithms from Machine Learning course of coursera taught by Prof. Andrew Ng.
Those algorithms will build a solid foundations for rookies in Machine Learning fields. 
The emphases of the project would be the implementation of those algorithms using Matlab and I would add necessary equations and explanations on the annotations. 
For now, the main categories include classification (Bayes classifier, Perceptron, SVM, Linear Regression), PCA, Kernel, simple Neural Networks, clustering, decision tree and ensemble learning.
The categories might be confusing but I will revise them on the process of coding.
