# Decision Tree

Implementing Decision Tree with Boosting and Bagging.

* Implementing simple ID3 decision tree:
 * Use "struct" structure in Matlab to build a tree;
 * Choose a feature with maxmum information gain at each level;
 * Return a leaf when there is only one class remaining in the data, or there are no features left.
 * Cannot deal with continuous variables currently
